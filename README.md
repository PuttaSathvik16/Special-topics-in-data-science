# Northeastern United States traffic accident trends: a geospatial and statistical analysis using python

**Overview**

This project analyzes traffic accident trends in the northeastern United States, with a particular focus on Connecticut and its neighboring states—New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. By leveraging a dataset encompassing fatal collisions, driver behaviors, and car insurance premiums, this study explores the correlations between risky driving habits, accident outcomes, and financial implications.

**Objectives**

Investigate the impact of speeding, alcohol-impaired driving, and distracted driving on accident outcomes.
Analyze regional differences in accident risk factors and compare Connecticut’s performance to other northeastern states.
Examine the relationship between accident trends and car insurance costs.
Utilize geospatial analysis and statistical modeling to identify actionable insights for policymakers.

**Methodology**
**Data Collection:** Publicly available datasets from government and regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
**Data Preprocessing:**
Handling missing values using imputation techniques.
Normalization and outlier detection to ensure consistency.
Feature selection for key traffic safety and insurance-related metrics.
**Analysis & Visualization:**
Statistical modeling using Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
Comparative analysis of accident trends and insurance cost variations across states.
Key Findings
Connecticut has a lower rate of fatal collisions per billion miles than the national average but exhibits high rates of speeding and alcohol-impaired driving.
Insurance premiums in Connecticut are above average due to higher accident risks and associated financial losses.
Neighboring states like Massachusetts and New York outperform Connecticut in some key safety metrics, suggesting potential policy improvements.
Tools & Technologies
**Programming Language:** Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
**Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, AWS (for scalable processing)
Conclusion
The study provides valuable insights into traffic safety trends and their economic implications, offering a data-driven perspective for improving road safety policies. By implementing targeted interventions and leveraging technology, states can reduce accident risks and associated financial burdens.
